Analysis

observation 1: looks like self modifying code.
name has to be greater than 2

hmm wish there was more, would have documented but was so "into" the crackme
that i just didn't bother, just used pen and paper

anyways i'll just provide a brief explanation.
smc, code gets decrypted based on some bit test operation, for keygen all
i did was, write on paper, code for 1st decryption loop when cf = 0 and when cf = 1
and the same for 2nd & 3rd decryption routine. In keygen I have a routine that builds
execution flow [quite nice i think so :P] based on bit-test operations.
Must say that i do dislike reversing recursive routines but hey i did it.
Thanks Vallani for the KeygenMe. I hope Keygen works as expected. Sorry for no source comments,
the source code is rather hackish? if i have time i might clean it up. You may notice that it
resembles the actual keygenme code, i just couldn't be bothered to re-implement the recursive
routine, tho maybe i might go back and see what can be done about it. After all those Ctrl+F2
i can say that i'm quite intimiate with execution flow. Anyways Thanks for KeygenMe.
